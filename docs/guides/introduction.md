# Introduction

## Purpose of CQL

CQL (Crystal Query Language) is a powerful tool designed for developers working with the Crystal programming language. It provides a streamlined interface for interacting with SQL databases, combining the flexibility of raw SQL with the safety and clarity of Crystalâ€™s type system. CQL simplifies complex database operations, making it easier to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, manage database schemas, and execute advanced queries.

### Key Features

* **Database-agnostic**: CQL supports multiple databases, ensuring flexibility in project development.
* **Active Record Pattern**: Integrates seamlessly with Crystal structs, allowing developers to work with database records as native Crystal objects.
* **Query Builder**: Provides an intuitive API for constructing complex SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and transactions.
* **Associations**: CQL supports defining relationships between tables (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, `many_to_many`), making it easy to navigate related data.
* **Migrations**: Facilitates schema evolution by allowing developers to create and manage database migrations.

### Supported Databases

CQL is designed to work with a range of SQL databases, including:

* **PostgreSQL**: Full support with advanced features like JSONB, arrays, and full-text search.
* **MySQL**: Support for common MySQL operations, though more advanced features may be limited.
* **SQLite**: Lightweight database support for development and testing environments.

### Use Cases

CQL is ideal for developers looking to integrate Crystal with SQL databases, providing a robust toolset for building data-driven applications. Whether you are developing a small-scale application or a large enterprise system, CQL offers the performance and scalability needed to manage your database operations efficiently.

# 3. Core Concepts

CQLâ€™s core concepts revolve around providing developers with tools to efficiently interact with databases through well-structured APIs. These concepts are fundamental to building and manipulating data models, performing queries, and managing transactions. Here's a high-level overview:

- **Schemas:** Define the structure of the database, including tables, columns, and data types.
- **CRUD Operations:** Simplify creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.
- **Query Builder:** Enables constructing SQL queries using Crystal code with features like joins and subqueries.
- **Transactions:** Ensure safe and atomic execution of multiple database operations.

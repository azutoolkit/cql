# Guides

The CQL (Crystal Query Language) Toolkit simplifies the management and execution of SQL queries in Crystal. It supports CRUD operations, complex query building, and uses patterns like Active Record and Repository for efficient data management. CQL is compatible with multiple databases, including PostgreSQL. Features include schema definition, query execution, data insertion, updating, and deletion. It also provides support for associations like has_many, belongs_to, and many_to_many.
